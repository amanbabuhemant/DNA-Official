## 🚩 Problem Statement: What Are We Solving?

In many college campuses and developer communities:
- 🚫 **No centralized platform** for showcasing student projects, contributions, or upcoming events.
- 🔍 **Lack of visibility** for tech teams and open-source contributors.
- 😞 **Disconnected community** with scattered communications.
- 💼 **No accessible career tools** (like resume builders or AI mentors) for early-stage developers.

### 🛠️ DNA Forge Hub is changing that by:

- Centralizing community efforts, events, teams, and resources in one place.
- Giving a professional face to student-led initiatives and open-source contributors.
- Creating a space to explore, collaborate, and innovate together.
- Planning to integrate **AI tools** that will supercharge developer growth.
