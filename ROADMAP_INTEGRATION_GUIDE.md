## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema
```sql
-- New fields added to content_items table
ALTER TABLE content_items ADD COLUMN external_url TEXT;
ALTER TABLE content_items ADD COLUMN difficulty TEXT;
ALTER TABLE content_items ADD COLUMN deadline TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE;
ALTER TABLE content_items ADD COLUMN prize TEXT;
ALTER TABLE content_items ADD COLUMN company TEXT;
```

### Content Structure
```typescript
interface RoadmapContent {
  title: string;           // e.g., "Frontend Developer"
  content: string;         // Description and category info
  type: 'roadmap';         // Content type
  status: 'published';     // Auto-published
  external_url: string;    // Link to roadmap.sh
  difficulty: string;      // beginner|intermediate|advanced
  tags: string[];          // Technology tags
  featured: boolean;       // Highlight important roadmaps
}
```

### Import Process
